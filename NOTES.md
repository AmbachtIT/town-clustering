# Transport Fever 3 modding notes

Reverse-engineered from the shipped `api/tealdef` definitions and base game
scripts. `wiki.transportfever3.com` returns Permission Denied, so none of this
is from documentation — treat it as findings, and re-verify after game patches.

Paths below are relative to the install:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Transport Fever 3`

## Where town positions come from

A new game's towns are generated **in the menu, in C++**, not in Lua:

1. `gui/menu/new_game_or_map_settings_page.tl` builds an *empty* map with
   `app.makeEmptyMap(...)` and a `HeighmapGenerationMode` with
   `generateTowns = true`.
2. It hands both to the native `builtin.MapPreviewComp`, along with `seed`,
   `locationsConfig` and the terrain generator params.
3. The component generates heightmap + towns + industries and returns the
   finished `GameMap` via `onReady`, which stores it in `mapState`.
4. `app.startGame2(map, ...)` (line ~628) starts the game from that map.

So the `GameMap` handed to `startGame2` already contains final town positions.
Rewriting `map.towns` between step 3 and step 4 is the whole mod.

`BaseConfig.Locations.TownParamList` exposes only `townFrequency`,
`populationDensity`, `maxNumberPerArea` and `allowInRoughTerrain` — density,
never spatial pattern. There is no native clustering knob.

## Mod layout

Modelled on `mods/release/urbangames_sandbox`:

```
<modid>/
  mod.json                  modId, revision, params, pre/post/runScript, severity*
  _content.json             { "archives": null, "files": [ ... ] }  paths under content/
  _metadata/modinfo.json    name, description, authors, tags
  content/...
```

Resource names drop `content/` and the final `.tl`/`.lua`:
`content/foo.script.tl` is addressed as `<modid>::/foo.script`.

Script hooks in `mod.json` use `"<modid>::/<file>.script@<fn>"`.
`preRunFn(captureParams, configDict, allModParams, baseConfig)` is where
`baseConfig.*` is tweaked — see `base/mod.script.tl:16`.

## GUI extension

`gui/main/bootstrap_game.tl` reads every generic resource of type
`react-replacement-config` and calls `<filePath>@<doReplaceFn>(api)` exactly
once, before any recipe runs. The callback gets `api.ReplaceRecipe(original,
replacement)`.

A generic resource is a `.res.lua` returning `{ type = "...", data = {...} }`.

Replacement works on **builtins** too — `GloballyReplaceRecipeBeforeInitInternal`
just writes `_react.recipeReplace[recipeId]` (`gui/main/react.lua:445`). Only
`react.CallOriginalRecipe` refuses builtins (`react.lua:459`). The dispatcher
reads the replacement table at *call* time (`react.lua:383`), so you can reach
the original by clearing your own entry around the call. `react.GetRecipeId` is
exported (`react.lua:742`).

Replacements are keyed by recipe id globally, and a replacement must itself be a
registered recipe (`react.RegisterRecipe`) or hooks inside it will run in the
caller's context.

## Lua states: mod hooks vs GUI (learned the hard way)

There is more than one Lua state, and a module must not straddle them.

A module referenced from `mod.json` (`preRunScript` / `postRunScript` /
`runScript`) is loaded in the **mod / game-init** state, on a `Load Game Pool`
thread. Requiring `::/gui/main/builtin.lua` there fails: `_react.builtin` is
empty, `DeclareBuiltinWithUserdata` logs `Missing builtin recipeId for`, and
game init aborts with `Could not init game` and a "please remove mod" dialog.

So the split is mandatory:

| file | state | referenced from | may require `::/gui/...` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `town_clustering.script.tl` | mod / game-init | `mod.json` hooks | **no** |
| `town_clustering_gui.script.tl` | GUI | `react-replacement-config` | yes |

A broken mod here does not corrupt anything - the game refuses to start the
game and names the mod - but it does block loading until the mod is fixed or
removed.

## What the menu does and does not load

Confirmed by probing:

- `mod.json` **is** read in the main menu: the mod's `params` render as sliders
  on the mod settings page, the chosen indices persist to `settings.lua` under
  `mainMenuState.activeModsParamsState.<modid>`, and enabling the mod raises the
  "no achievements" warning.
- Nothing under `content/` was observed to run in the menu - not the
  `.res.lua`'s `data()`, not a `.gres.lua` shipped at a base content path.

So manifest-level activation is not the same as content being loaded. Still
open: whether content is genuinely never loaded in the menu, or whether
resource `data()` results are served from the content cache the log mentions
("Reading content cache from json for dir ..."). The `preRunFn` probe is there
to settle it.

## Open questions (Phase 0 spike)

1. **Does `_reactDoReplaceRecipes` run for the menu UI state at all?** The
   engine hardcodes two GUI entry points — `gui/main/game.lua` and
   `gui/menu/main_menu.tl` — and only the first one loads `bootstrap_game.tl`.
   If the menu is a separate Lua state, it never gets replacements and this
   approach cannot work. **This gates everything else.**
2. Can a replaced builtin be called through to, via the clear/restore trick?
3. Does handing a `GameMap` back as `initialMap` make the preview draw *our*
   towns, or is `initialMap` only read at mount? Fallback is `inputMap` with
   `generateTowns = false` — flip `FEEDBACK_MODE` in the script.
4. How is `GameMap.heightmap` indexed relative to `numTilesX/numTilesY` and
   `resolution`, and what is the shape/range of `Town.sizeFactors`?

A `MapPreviewComp`-level wrapper probably **cannot** read the mod's own slider
values: they live in `activeModsParamsState`, a react state threaded through the
*page*, and there is no `app`-level accessor in the menu
(`api.engine.config.getModParams()` is engine-side, in-game only). Agreed
fallback is to fork the page recipe, which has both in scope, wrapped in `pcall`
with `CallOriginalRecipe` so a patch degrades to the stock dialog.

## Terrain generators and node trees (the route that works)

A terrain generator is a `.gen.lua` declaring `nodeTree` + `params` (the
sliders). Mod-supplied generators **do** appear in the new game dialog's
generator dropdown - confirmed in-game - which makes this the only mod-reachable
lever on the free game dialog. It is how the "Flatter Maps" mod works.

A node tree (`.tree.lua`, ~139KB for temperate) is a saved node-editor graph:
a flat list of nodes linked **by name**, which makes splicing easy.

```lua
{
    color = { ... },
    inputs = { in1 = { key = "out", nodeName = "<other node>" }, },
    layerType = "add_map",
    name = "<unique>",
    params = { ... },
    position = { x, y, },
}
```

Temperate has 325 nodes across 45 layerTypes. Outputs are only
`height_map_output`, `output_biomes` and `assets_output` - **there is no town
output**, so a generator can only shape terrain and let the placer react.

Sliders enter the graph as `param_number` nodes with `params = { key = "mountains" }`,
matching a `params` entry in the `.gen.lua`. Node params can also be driven by
wires: some stock `map_clamp_map` nodes take `from`/`to` as inputs rather than
params. That is the route to a real "cluster count" slider.

There is an in-game node editor (`menu.mapEditor.nodeEditor.window`, button in
the Map Editor game bar; `local/autosave.tree.lua.bak` is its scratch file).

### Gotcha: output keys are not always "out"

An input references a producer as `{ key = <output name>, nodeName = <node> }`.
Most nodes publish their result as `out`, but the `gui/node_editor/*.node`
subgraph types do not:

| producing layerType | output key |
|---|---|
| `gui/node_editor/remap_number.node` | `output` |
| `gui/node_editor/combine_point.node` | `point` |
| everything else seen so far | `out` |

Using the wrong key fails during generation with
`Assertion 'it != map.end()' failed` (`map_util.h:22`, `Get`) - the same
message you get for a missing parameter, with nothing naming the node at
fault. `tools/check_tree.py` now derives the valid output keys per layerType
from stock usage and checks them.

### Driving node params from a slider

A `.gen.lua` slider reaches the graph as a `param_number` node whose `params.key`
matches the slider key. It outputs a **normalised 0..1**, which the stock trees
then map onto a useful range with `gui/node_editor/remap_number.node`
(`params a_x/a_y` = input range, `b_x/b_y` = output range, `clamp`).

Most node params can also be driven by a wire instead of a literal, but only
where the node actually exposes that input. Useful cases found by scanning all
four stock trees:

| node | wireable inputs seen |
|---|---|
| `ridged_noise_map` | `baseFreq`, `gain`, `lacunarity`, `numOctaves`, `seed` |
| `map_clamp_map` | `in1`, `from`, `to` (`from`/`to` are **points**) |
| `distance_map` | `threshold` |
| `white_noise_map` | `probability` |
| `mul_number` / `add_number` | `in1`, `in2` |

`constant_number`, `constant_point`, `constant_map` and `param_number` never
take inputs - they are pure sources. To turn numbers into a point (needed for
`map_clamp_map.from`/`to`) use `gui/node_editor/combine_point.node`, which takes
`x` and `y` as numbers.

`normalize_map` (`params range_x/range_y`) is worth using after any noise node
whose natural output range you do not know, so downstream thresholds are
meaningful.

### Gotcha: required inputs

A node missing a required input crashes map generation with an unhelpful
`GraphException: Missing input data`
(`layer_generator_util.cpp:142`, `DataHolder::StartTask`) - taking the whole
game down from the new game dialog.

`voronoi_noise_map` looks like the obvious tool for clusters but **requires a
`cellIndex` input** (all four stock trees wire one) and it is not clear what a
valid cell-index map is. `fractal_noise_map` needs only `seed`, so basins are
built from low-frequency noise instead.

`tools/check_tree.py` infers each layerType's required inputs from stock usage
and validates a generated tree before it ever reaches the game. Run it after
every `build_tree.py`.

## Environment

- TF3 is Steam appid **3493540**.
- User mods: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<id>\3493540\local\mods\`
  (`staging_area\` beside it is the other mod source, the one the exe's
  `--validate StagingArea,<mod>` CLI refers to).
- Log: `...\3493540\local\crash_dump\stdout.txt`.
- The exe also exposes `--validate`, `--validate-all`, `--and-cook`, `--exec`
  and `--script`, not yet explored.
- No Lua or Teal toolchain is installed, so `tlconfig.lua` is for an editor;
  the game compiles `.tl` at load time and reports failures to the log.

## Rebuilding town roads from a game script (learned the hard way)

`api.cmd.makeTownConnectWithIndustriesCmd(entities, connections, keep)` takes a
`keep` flag. `keep = false` means *remove the existing streets first*, then lay
out a fresh network.

Do not pass `false` from a game script in a running game. It crashed TF3
build 40408 with an access violation on the **Simulation Thread**
(`TransportFever3.exe+0xA4BD7`, read of a freed pointer) about three seconds
after the command was sent, with the minidump recorded while the engine was
still printing `Init streets add proposal error` lines for that same command.

The Map Editor uses `keep = false` safely because nothing is simulating there.
By the time a game script's first tick has created towns and waited for them to
appear, the world has buildings, industries and people in it, and removing every
street leaves the engine holding stale references.

`keep = true` adds the missing links instead and is the only safe option here.
The cost is cosmetic: `makeTownDestroyCmd` takes a town's own streets with it,
but an inter-town road that led to a destroyed town can survive as a stub.

### Connection indices are the engine's, not Lua's

`getDefaultTownConnections` returns "indices into the vector townEntities", and
that vector is C++ - the indices are **0-based**, while every list on the Lua
side is 1-based. Appending a 1-based pair to the returned list and sending it
back crashed the simulation thread twice, in the same engine function
(`TransportFever3.exe+0xA4BD7` and `+0xA4BE3`), reading out of range - the second
time from `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`, which is what running off the end of that vector
looks like. Both crashes landed at the very end of the street layout, exactly
where the appended links sat.

Treating the engine's own indices as 1-based is quietly wrong in the other
direction: a guard of `index >= 1` drops every connection that touches town 0,
which invents components that are not really separate.

The mod now derives the base from the data instead of assuming: a zero anywhere
proves 0-based, a value equal to the town count proves 1-based, and if neither
appears the sample proves nothing and it sends the engine's proposal unaltered.

Two more things worth knowing about that command:

- `api.engine.mapgen.getDefaultTownConnections` is a **proposal**, not a
  complete network. The Map Editor merges it into the connections it already has
  ("Propose Default Connections", `gui/map_editor/map_editor.tl`). On a
  clustered map it leaves each cluster as its own island.
- Even a fully connected proposal is not a fully connected map. The engine
  refuses individual links with `Too Much Incline` or `Collision` and logs
  `Towns 'A' and 'B'  NOT connected`. The stock generator hits this too.

## Creating towns from a game script

`gui/map_editor/map_editor.tl` (`makeTowns`) is the worked example:

```
api.engine.terrain.makeMapFromGame(false, true, false, false)  -- current towns
api.engine.mapgen.createTowns(seed, desired)                   -- {toRemove, toAdd}
api.cmd.makeTownDestroyCmd / api.cmd.makeTownCreateCmd
```

A `GameMap.Town` carrying its `existing` entity is left alone; one without it is
built fresh. Any town in the world the list no longer names comes back in
`toRemove`. `makeMapFromGame` fills in names, `sizeFactors` and
`landUse2CargoNeeds`, so a relocated town can inherit its own identity instead of
having those fields invented.

Creation is asynchronous and not fast: 18 towns took about two and a half
minutes of game ticks to appear on a medium map.
